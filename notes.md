- [x] Narrative around writing the weather app rather than strict itemization
- [ ] "As non-systems programmers, we're used to..."
- [ ] Slower on code slides
- [ ] Take out "before we really get started"
- [x] Cut the code only from the intro examples
- [ ] Slower for that `println!` slide at the end
- [ ] Less jargon
  - [ ] Derive, trait
  - [ ] type-safe `isinstance`
- [ ] Spend a little more time with the Python program
- [ ] `WrapErr`: "to more accurately describe what went wrong" instead of "attaching context"
- [ ] More time on "who is this talk for"

## Notes from Nell
- [ ] Great intro
- [ ] Linger on code slides a few seconds longer before going to the next one -
      especially ones with more than 5 lines of code
- [ ] good job setting expectations
- [ ] pause to BREATHE throughout your talk (maybe put those pauses directly in
      your speaker notes) - this will help you slow down, especially if you are a
      little nervous
- [ ] cute receipt picture
- [ ] good api key joke

## Notes from Jane

- [ ] slide before why i like rust went too fast
- [ ] the explanation of result was a little detailed
- [ ] show what the python program with the weather api outputs
- [ ] instead of "to attach context" say "to more accurately describe what went wrong"

## Notes from Si√¢n

- [x] DEFAULT TO KELVIN IS PERFECTLY REASONABLE
- [x] Your code is in general really well formatted and easy to read
- [ ] I'd move the receipt photo earlier, it's a good hook
- [ ] StructOpt example is a bit distracting for the point you're making
- [ ] Same for serde, too much code
- [ ] Colorful diffs was great though
- [ ] Almost 5 minutes is spent pitching your talk
- [ ] On tooling slide: "which you're probably already familiar with" only
      makes people who aren't feel bad
- [ ] 10 minutes in, we're still "before we really get started"
- [ ] "Rust has operator overloading" thrown out with no explanation in a
      section where it's assuming the audience is brand new to Rust
- [ ] Result explanation throws out a ton of jargon, folks will either
      already know what you're saying or be completely lost
- [ ] "Type safe isinstance check" assumes a lot of prior knowledge
- [ ] "by deriving a trait" is a really odd phrase to use if this is
      intended for very new developers
- [ ] Structopt slide shows up again, is still distracting and not
      supporting what you're saying
- [ ] I love showing off the "did you mean" feature
- [ ] Ok I thought it was eye-ree, thanks Jane
- [ ] You call the ? operator "the tries" with no explanation, it's not
      clear to folks who weren't around in the days of the try macro what
      you meant
- [ ] Slide showing named println formatting arguments has too much code and
      too little time
